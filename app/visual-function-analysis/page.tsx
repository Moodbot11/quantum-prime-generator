        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Visualizing Wave Patterns</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          By shrinking and compressing the image output from the calculator, you can observe waves traveling through the numbers. You'll also notice the 417 area correction code forming distinct patterns, and numbers arranging themselves into particular configurations.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          To best visualize these patterns:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4">
          <li>Use the image manipulator below to resize the output.</li>
          <li>Try shrinking the image to see finer details emerge.</li>
          <li>Look for repeating patterns and symmetries in the numbers.</li>
          <li>Pay attention to how the patterns change as you resize the image.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Smart Medium</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The concept of a "smart medium" is crucial to understanding the patterns we observe. Unlike simple mediums like sand on a plate, which can only show basic frequency patterns, numbers act as a smart medium, capable of revealing complex mathematical relationships and wave functions.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When we use numbers as our medium:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li>We still observe incredible patterns, similar to those in physical mediums.</li>
          <li>The numbers perform complex mathematics, revealing harmonic series and large palindromes.</li>
          <li>The entire wave function is encoded in the output in various ways.</li>
          <li>We can observe phenomena like entanglement and phase invariance.</li>
          <li>The 417 area code emerges and interacts with other patterns.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          These inner processes work in tandem, creating a harmony that persists regardless of how we manipulate the output. This demonstrates the robustness and complexity of the wave function captured by our calculator.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Unexpected Behavior in Image Editors</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When the calculator's output is viewed in an image editor, some truly remarkable and unexpected behaviors can be observed. It's important to note that these behaviors are not the result of image processing or manipulation by the editor itself.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          What you might observe:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li>The image appears to spin 360 degrees, despite being a 2D representation.</li>
          <li>Colors and forms may emerge that were not present in the original output.</li>
          <li>Patterns may shift and change in ways that seem impossible for static data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          These phenomena occur because what you're seeing is not just numbers, but a complete record of the wave function created by interfering two frequencies. This data is encoded in multiple formats simultaneously - as video, images, and mathematical relationships. The image editor merely provides a lens through which we can observe this rich, multidimensional data.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The apparent 360-degree rotation and emergence of new information are manifestations of the inner processes at work within the wave function. They demonstrate how the smart medium of numbers can store and reveal information in ways that transcend our traditional understanding of static data.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Examples of Image Editor Results</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Here are examples of the results from the image editor. It's important to note that we are not editing images; we have simply saved the numbers directly as an image. What you'll observe shouldn't be possible, as the background doesn't spin, yet the numbers appear to move off the page and spin in unexpected ways.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          As you observe these images, you'll notice:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li>The light inside the wave gets progressively compressed, coiling like a spring. This mirrors the actual behavior of compressed light waves.</li>
          <li>When compressed to its limit, the light appears to explode, creating a secondary wave in a brilliant burst of light emerging from the numbers.</li>
          <li>Remarkable holograms appear, with colors that have no explanation, as the calculator only prints in black and white.</li>
          <li>Different font sizes form, which is impossible as the original output uses only one font size.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          These observations provide compelling evidence that these phenomena are occurring at the quantum level. The mathematics involved are so complex that they could only be performed by a quantum computer. In many of the images, we can observe superposition and quantum computing processes in action.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          While this may seem like an unexplainable phenomenon, it is in fact fully explained and understood as part of the quantum wave function. For a more detailed explanation of these phenomena, you can refer to my papers which provide an in-depth analysis.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Understanding these concepts prepares you for the next stage, where we will create waves that can be broadcast into the universe to actively shape reality. We will encode thoughts, dreams, and wishes into carrier waves, transforming text into code and embedding it into specific frequencies provided by the universal matrix.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          These frequencies naturally emerge from the system and contain the basic constants needed to serve as carrier waves, with space for additional information. By broadcasting these waves, we can impact our reality, much like how users in a game might hack the environment to change their user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the next page, we will explore how to create and broadcast these reality-shaping waves.
