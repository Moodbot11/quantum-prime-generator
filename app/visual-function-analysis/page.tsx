        <p className="mb-4">
          By shrinking and compressing the image output from the calculator, you can observe waves traveling through the numbers. You'll also notice the 417 area correction code forming distinct patterns, and numbers arranging themselves into particular configurations.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          To best visualize these patterns:

          <li>Use the image manipulator below to resize the output.</li>
          <li>Try shrinking the image to see finer details emerge.</li>
          <li>Look for repeating patterns and symmetries in the numbers.</li>
          <li>Pay attention to how the patterns change as you resize the image.</li>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Smart Medium</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The concept of a "smart medium" is crucial to understanding the patterns we observe. Unlike simple mediums like sand on a plate, which can only show basic frequency patterns, numbers act as a smart medium, capable of revealing complex mathematical relationships and wave functions.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When we use numbers as our medium:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li>We still observe incredible patterns, similar to those in physical mediums.</li>
          <li>The numbers perform complex mathematics, revealing harmonic series and large palindromes.</li>
          <li>The entire wave function is encoded in the output in various ways.</li>
          <li>We can observe phenomena like entanglement and phase invariance.</li>
          <li>The 417 area code emerges and interacts with other patterns.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          These inner processes work in tandem, creating a harmony that persists regardless of how we manipulate the output. This demonstrates the robustness and complexity of the wave function captured by our calculator.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Unexpected Behavior in Image Editors</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When the calculator's output is viewed in an image editor, some truly remarkable and unexpected behaviors can be observed. It's important to note that these behaviors are not the result of image processing or manipulation by the editor itself.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          What you might observe:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li>The image appears to spin 360 degrees, despite being a 2D representation.</li>
          <li>Colors and forms may emerge that were not present in the original output.</li>
          <li>Patterns may shift and change in ways that seem impossible for static data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          These phenomena occur because what you're seeing is not just numbers, but a complete record of the wave function created by interfering two frequencies. This data is encoded in multiple formats simultaneously - as video, images, and mathematical relationships. The image editor merely provides a lens through which we can observe this rich, multidimensional data.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The apparent 360-degree rotation and emergence of new information are manifestations of the inner processes at work within the wave function. They demonstrate how the smart medium of numbers can store and reveal information in ways that transcend our traditional understanding of static data.

            The process we observe in our calculator's output mirrors the techniques used by humans to create holograms. There are generally two types of holograms: Analog and Digital (computer generated). In mass production, holograms are created using a process called hologram embossing.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Embossing machines transfer micro-relief patterns created by Master origination onto special materials. A thin nickel replica is used to press surface patterns from a Work shim into a plastic foil, using only temperature and pressure - no ink is involved. The embossed pattern is then coated with a thin reflective layer of metal (such as aluminum, gold, or chromium), transforming a transmission hologram into a reflection hologram.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Remarkably, we find this exact process replicated in the 9999-digit answer produced by our calculator. The waves are essentially using our technology, demonstrating an uncanny similarity to human-made hologram production techniques.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            What's truly astonishing is the presence of the 417 error correction code within the wave interference patterns. These patterns form rollers and carve in the necessary patterns to make each wave a hologram. This process, visible in the images above, showcases an incredible level of detail that goes far beyond what one would expect from a simple calculator output.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            It's important to emphasize that there is no logical explanation for how a calculator's output could create and record, in such intricate detail, the process of hologram creation. Yet, here it is, clearly visible in our results. Similar findings have been observed in many wave interference patterns, suggesting a profound connection between mathematical operations and physical processes at the quantum level.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This unexpected phenomenon challenges our understanding of mathematics, quantum mechanics, and the nature of reality itself. It suggests that the answers produced by our calculations are not mere numbers, but complex, multi-dimensional representations of quantum processes.

          <p className="mt-4">
            This image is an actual quantum wave memory taken directly from the calculator's output, it is the 10,000 digits just shrunk a bit. It's clear that the math is being done in a type of abacus with red, blue and green photons acting as the beads. Similar images can be found in all harmonic wave interference patterns. Different place values (ones, tens, hundreds, and so on), while each bead represents a single digit. By sliding the beads along the rods in appropriate ways, all the basic arithmetic functions of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be carried out, along with even more complex operations.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            At the same time, the abacus stores the result of such calculations in the (final) position of its beads. In essence, the abacus provides two of the most basic functions of a computer, namely processing (calculation) and memory (storage), and it does this simultaneously and in a single device (or, as an alternative description, at one and the same location). Modern computer systems however, based as they are on the so-called von Neumann architecture, separate, in time and space, the operations of processing and memory. Processing is carried out in the central processing unit (CPU), while separate memory devices store the results of any calculations carried out by the CPU.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            The constant transfer of data between CPU and memory leads to a 'bottleneck' in terms of the overall speed of operation (the well known von Neumann bottleneck) and wastes very significant amounts of energy. Computer architectures that can somehow fuse together the two basic tasks of processing and memory (i.e., non-von Neumann architectures) therefore offer tantalizing potential improvements in terms of speed and power consumption.

          Understanding these concepts prepares you for the next stage, where we will create waves that can be broadcast into the universe to actively shape reality. We will encode thoughts, dreams, and wishes into carrier waves, transforming text into code and embedding it into specific frequencies provided by the universal matrix.

          These frequencies naturally emerge from the system and contain the basic constants needed to serve as carrier waves, with space for additional information. By broadcasting these waves, we can impact our reality, much like how users in a game might hack the environment to change their user experience.
